# SMS Spam Classification Project

## Overview
A machine learning system that classifies SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature extraction. The model automatically detects spam messages by converting text into numerical features and making predictions based on learned patterns.

## Project Structure
This project demonstrates a complete text classification pipeline:
- Data loading and preprocessing from Kaggle dataset
- TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction
- Logistic Regression model training
- SMS message classification and prediction

## Dataset
The project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, available via Kaggle. The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as either "spam" or "ham" in tab-separated format without headers.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Automatic TF-IDF vectorization converts raw text into meaningful numerical features
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression classifier for reliable spam detection
- **Model Training**: Train-test split ensures proper model evaluation
- **Prediction Capability**: Classify new, unseen SMS messages in real-time

## Installation Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- kagglehub

## Usage
The model can process individual messages or batches of SMS texts, returning classification results as "spam" or "ham". It's particularly effective at identifying common spam patterns like urgency tactics, prize notifications, and suspicious links.

## Model Performance
The system demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate messages and spam, making it suitable for real-world applications like mobile messaging apps and email spam filters.

## Applications
- Mobile messaging spam filtering
- Email classification systems
- Text analysis and content moderation
- Educational tool for understanding NLP and machine learning pipelines

This project serves as an excellent foundation for understanding text classification and can be extended with additional features like deep learning models or real-time API integration.
