# ML for AI Security üõ°Ô∏èü§ñ

A public repository dedicated to exploring the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and AI security. This project contains implementations, research, and experiments on how ML can be used for cyber defense, as well as how ML systems themselves can be vulnerable to attacks.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following key areas:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Adversarial_Attack/`** | Code and resources related to generating adversarial examples to fool ML models. |
| **`DDOS_Attack/`** | Projects focused on using ML for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) detection and mitigation. |
| **`Malicious_URL/`** | ML models and datasets for classifying and detecting malicious URLs. |
| **`SMS_Spam_Classification/`** | A classic NLP project to identify and filter spam text messages. |
| **`Trojan_Horse/`** | Research and code exploring Trojan attacks (backdoors) in neural networks. |
| **`White_Box_Attack/`** | Implementations of white-box adversarial attacks where the attacker has full knowledge of the model. |

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

This repository is actively evolving. In the future, we plan to expand its scope to include cutting-edge topics in AI security and safety, such as:

*   **More LLM Attacks:** Exploring prompt injection, jailbreaking, model theft, and other vulnerabilities specific to Large Language Models.
*   **AI Safety Research:** Investigating topics like model alignment, robustness, interpretability, and the prevention of unintended behaviors in advanced AI systems.
*   **Model Extraction & Inversion**
*   **Data Poisoning Techniques**
*   **Federated Learning Security**
